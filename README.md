# SMART-DIET :  

SMART-DIET is AI diet predictor which can help those who wanted to lose weight, gain weight or maintain their weight according to the user's personality and by this people lead a healthier Life.
It is web-based project that provides personalized diet recommendations using artificial intelligence. It helps users plan healthy meals based on their body details, goals, and activity levels.
